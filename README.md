# My-first-refactor-completed-ohyeah

This first challenge of the bootcamp was to refactor the given Horiseon website. These are the changes that I have made:<br><br>
-Added appropriate semantic elements in the HTML file.<br>
-Fixed all broken links to make them functioning properly.<br>
-Fixed the head title to be descriptive for seo purposes.<br>
-Reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties.<br>
-Organized the CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.<br>
