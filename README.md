# My-first-refactor-completed-ohyeah

This first challenge of the bootcamp was to refactor the given Horiseon website to meet accessibility standards so the site is optimized for search engines.<br><br>
These are the changes that I have made:<br><br>
<li>Added appropriate semantic elements in the HTML file.<br>
<li>Fixed all broken links to make them functioning properly.<br>
<li>Fixed the head title to be descriptive for seo purposes.<br>
<li>Reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties.<br>
<li>Organized the CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.<br>
<li>Included comments before each element or section of the page.<br>
<li>Added accessible alt attributes to the image elements.<br><br>
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:<br><br>
