# My-first-refactor-completed-ohyeah

This first challenge of the bootcamp was to refactor the given Horiseon website to meet accessibility standards so the site is optimized for search engines. These are the changes that I have made:<br><br>
-Added appropriate semantic elements in the HTML file.<br>
-Fixed all broken links to make them functioning properly.<br>
-Fixed the head title to be descriptive for seo purposes.<br>
-Reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties.<br>
-Organized the CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.<br>
-Included comments before each element or section of the page.<br>
-Added accessible alt attributes to the image elements.<br><br>
